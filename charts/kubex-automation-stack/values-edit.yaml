# To avoid scraping other instances of kube-state-metrics / node exporter (potentially old and/or configured 
# differently), the Prometheus server is configured with releaseNamespace set to true.
# However, we may have additional exporters required such as NVIDIA's DCGM exporter, typically deployed using the
# GPU Operator (https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator).
# If that is the case, uncomment the following section and add the relevant namespaces where these exporters are running:

# prometheus: # optional
  # server: 
    # namespaces:
    #   - <changeme-namespace>
