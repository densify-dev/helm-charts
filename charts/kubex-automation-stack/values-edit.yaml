# The following section is optional, and is required only in two use-cases:
# 1. The persistent volume for Prometheus has to use an explicit storage class (not the default)
# 2. For future use: we may have additional exporters required such as NVIDIA's DCGM exporter, 
#    typically deployed using the GPU Operator (https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) in its own namespace.
# In these two cases, uncomment the following section and the relevant sub-section/s:

# prometheus: # optional
  # server:
    # persistentVolume:
    #   storageClass: <changeme-storage-class>
    # namespaces:
    #   - <changeme-exporter-namespace>
